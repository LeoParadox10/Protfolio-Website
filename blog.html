                    <p>
                        If you are learning web development, you will come across terms like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        These are often called the building blocks of the Web.
                        These three tools dominate web development. Every library or tool seems to be centered around
                        HTML, CSS, and JS. So if you want to become a web developer, you need to learn them well.
                        You'll also discover that websites are mostly built from these three languages.

                    <h2> Competitive Programming - A Hype ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As said, competitive programming is a competition for programmers. You compete with other
                        programmers to solve the algorithmic programming puzzle as fast as possible. Popular
                        competitions include International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), and CodeForces.
                        If you`re interested, try it out! But if your main goal going in is to win, then reconsider. The
                        chances are not high, and most of the people who join competitive programming are there for fun.
